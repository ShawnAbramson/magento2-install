# magento2-install
Mac CLI command to install Magento 2.x.x + Docker + Redis + Xdebug + Sample Data for local Magento 2 development

This command allows you to easily spin up unlimited instances of any version Magento 2 for development on your local machine.  This is the exact same setup I have been using for years. It includes all of the goodies and extensions needed for M2 development.
